# Installing k0rdent

This installation chapter guides you through the essential steps to set up k0rdent, beginning with the creation of a dedicated management cluster that serves as the control plane. You'll then install the actual k0rdent software, followed by verifying that it's installed successfully. From there, you'll prepare the management cluster to provision and manage child clusters, laying the groundwork for deploying and scaling your Kubernetes workloads across different infrastructures.
