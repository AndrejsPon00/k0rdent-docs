# k0rdent User Guide

 This guide walks you through the basics of using k0rdent, such as spinning up your own Kubernetes clusters, and then gets into adding extras, such as tools, applications, and services, to those clusters. We'll show you how to use templates to make that easier, add those extras to your deployments, and keep an eye on everything. Plus, we'll cover how to make sure your clusters avoid configuration drift. Basically, it's all about getting your apps running smoothly with k0rdent.
